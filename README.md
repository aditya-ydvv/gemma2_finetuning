# Gemma 2 Fine-Tuning for Language or Cultural Context

This project is part of a competition to fine-tune **Gemma 2** for specific language or cultural contexts. The goal is to create clear and easy-to-follow notebooks that empower others to learn and contribute to the development of language models tailored to diverse communities.

## Project Overview

In this repository, we demonstrate the entire process of fine-tuning **Gemma 2**, starting with dataset creation and curation, followed by model fine-tuning, and concluding with inference and evaluation. 

The key steps in this project are:

1. **Dataset Creation/Curation**
2. **Fine-tuning Gemma**
3. **Inference and Evaluation**

## 1. Dataset Creation/Curation

# Detailed Data Creation Process for Gemma 2 Fine-Tuning

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the **data creation and preprocessing** pipeline used to prepare the dataset for fine-tuning the Gemma 2 model. This process ensures that the data aligns with the target language and cultural context, with a focus on high quality and cultural appropriateness.

## 1. Data Sources

The dataset used in this project consists primarily of **song lyrics**. Song lyrics were selected because they represent a wide range of linguistic expressions, including figurative language, idiomatic expressions, and culturally specific references. This variety poses an interesting challenge for fine-tuning language models, as it tests their ability to understand complex, creative text. The data was sourced from [insert source names], ensuring that it includes diverse samples relevant to the target language or culture.

### Considerations for Data Source Selection
- **Representation**: Ensuring the dataset is representative of the target language or cultural group.
- **Quality**: High-quality sources were prioritized, avoiding any low-quality text that could introduce noise into the model training process.
- **Cultural Relevance**: The dataset reflects linguistic and cultural nuances, making it suitable for fine-tuning in a culturally specific context.

## 2. Preprocessing Steps

Once the raw data was collected, it underwent several preprocessing steps to prepare it for fine-tuning Gemma 2. The steps were designed to clean, tokenize, and format the data while maintaining its integrity and cultural sensitivity.

### a. Text Cleaning

The text cleaning process involved removing elements that could hinder the model’s ability to learn from the data. Specific actions included:
- **Removing Non-Essential Characters**: Characters such as HTML tags, special symbols (e.g., `@`, `#`, etc.), and punctuation marks (where not critical for meaning) were stripped from the text.
- **Handling Inconsistent Whitespace**: Redundant spaces were removed, and the text was standardized to improve readability for the model.
- **Lowercasing**: All text was converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity. Since case sensitivity is generally not important for song lyrics, this step helps reduce the complexity of the model's vocabulary.

### b. Tokenization

Tokenization is a critical step in preparing the data for model training. For this project, **language-specific tokenization** methods were used, ensuring that the text was divided into manageable units (words or phrases) that the model could learn from effectively.

- **Word Tokenization**: The text was tokenized into individual words or meaningful subword units using a language-appropriate tokenizer.
- **Handling Multilingual Text**: Where the dataset involved multilingual or non-Latin scripts, the **indic-transliteration** library was used to convert non-Latin characters into Romanized form. This step ensures that the model can process the text without needing additional modifications to its input pipeline.

### c. Handling Missing Data

Data completeness is essential for the quality of the training dataset. In cases where missing or incomplete data was identified, the following measures were taken:
- **Filling Missing Data**: Minor gaps, such as missing punctuation, were automatically corrected where it made sense (e.g., completing sentences).
- **Removing Incomplete Entries**: Entries with substantial missing data that could not be resolved were removed from the dataset to avoid introducing noise during model training.

### d. Cultural Sensitivity and Relevance

Given the goal of fine-tuning Gemma 2 for a specific language or cultural context, it was critical to ensure that the data used in the training process was culturally sensitive and appropriate. The following steps were taken to address this:
- **Cultural Relevance**: The text was carefully reviewed to ensure that it accurately reflected the cultural and linguistic norms of the target community. Content that could be considered culturally inappropriate or offensive was excluded from the dataset.
- **Context Preservation**: While preprocessing the data, special care was taken not to strip away cultural references or expressions that are important for understanding the language's unique characteristics. For example, idioms and culturally specific phrases were preserved during the cleaning process.

### e. Data Formatting

After the preprocessing steps, the dataset was structured in a format compatible with Gemma 2’s fine-tuning pipeline. This involved:
- **Organizing the Data**: The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, with attention to maintaining a balanced distribution of language styles (e.g., lyrical, narrative).
- **Data Serialization**: The preprocessed data was serialized into the necessary format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for efficient loading during the model fine-tuning process.

### f. Data Augmentation (Optional)

To further enhance the dataset, **data augmentation techniques** were considered. These include adding slight variations to the existing text, such as paraphrasing sentences or altering word order, to increase the diversity of training examples. However, care was taken to ensure that these augmentations did not alter the meaning of culturally significant phrases or idioms.

## Conclusion

The dataset creation and preprocessing steps outlined above are designed to prepare a high-quality, culturally relevant dataset for fine-tuning the Gemma 2 model. By carefully curating the dataset and applying robust preprocessing techniques, we aim to create a model that not only performs well on the target language but also respects its cultural context. The detailed notebook accompanying this project provides all the code necessary to replicate and extend these preprocessing steps.

## 2. Fine-tuning Gemma

The next step is fine-tuning **Gemma 2** using the preprocessed dataset. The fine-tuning process involves:
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting the learning rate, batch size, and other key parameters to optimize model performance.
- **Training Procedures**: Details of the training epochs, optimizers used, and steps taken to prevent overfitting.
- **Techniques to Enhance Performance**: Methods such as few-shot prompting and retrieval-augmented generation were used to improve the model's ability to handle context-specific text.

## 3. Inference and Evaluation

Finally, after fine-tuning the model, we run inference to evaluate its performance. In this section, we demonstrate:
- **How to run inference** using the fine-tuned Gemma 2 model.
- **Evaluation metrics** to assess the quality of the model's output, including accuracy, BLEU score, and any human evaluation for language-specific nuances.

## Conclusion

This project provides a complete guide for creating a culturally adapted language model using **Gemma 2**. By fine-tuning the model for a specific language or cultural context, we aim to enhance its utility for diverse communities.
